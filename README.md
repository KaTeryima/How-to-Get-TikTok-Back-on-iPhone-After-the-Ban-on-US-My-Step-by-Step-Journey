# How-To-Get-TikTok-Back-On-iPhone
If you’ve been asking yourself how to get TikTok back on iPhone after the U.S. ban, you’re not alone. Just like me, I opened my phone one day only to realize TikTok had vanished. The ban left millions scrambling one moment you had the app, the next it was gone from the App Store with no way to redownload it.

In April 2024, the U.S. passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), which targeted apps like TikTok as national security risks. By January 19, 2025, after ByteDance failed to divest, Apple and Google officially removed TikTok from U.S. app stores. 
For iPhone users, this created a unique challenge unlike Android, where you can sideload APKs, iOS is tightly locked down. If Apple marks an app as “unavailable in your region,” you can’t redownload tiktok at all.
 After weeks of testing different methods, some trial and error, I finally found a way to get tiktok back on iphone without any VPN or change my App store region. I’ll also show you step by step how I managed to get TikTok back on my iPhone after the ban.

✅**My Personal Recommendation:** If you don't want to pay for a VPN then [download tiktok on your iPhone here for free](https://sites.google.com/view/jesgj/home). 
Let’s jump in.

## How To Redownload TikTok on iPhone
Here’s the exact sequence I followed to redownload tiktok on my iPhone — the version that worked for me. Use this as your blueprint, but expect a little trial and error (especially with VPN servers).

**Step 1:** Prepare a secondary (non-US) Apple ID
I created a brand new Apple ID with the region set to Canada (you can also try Mexico or the UK).


When setting it up, Apple may ask for an address, payment method, etc. Use a valid Canadian address (e.g. a random city’s address you find online). For payment methods, sometimes selecting “None” works if Apple allows it.


This Apple ID will let me access the Canadian App Store, where TikTok is still visible.


**Step 2:** Log out of my U.S. Apple ID on the iPhone
In Settings  [Your Name] → Sign Out, I signed out of my U.S. Apple ID entirely (iCloud, App Store, etc.).


Then I signed in using the new Canadian Apple ID for iTunes & App Store.


It’s important that all Apple services tied to the U.S. account are disconnected, to minimize Apple’s regional checks.


**Step 3:** Use a reliable VPN and connect to Canada (or another allowed country)
I installed a premium VPN (more on choosing one later), and connected to a Canadian server.


I verified via an IP check tool that my IP now showed a Canadian location.


Crucially, I enabled features like “obfuscation” or “stealth mode” (if available) to hide that this is VPN traffic.


**Step 4:** Open the (Canadian) App Store and download TikTok
Since my Apple ID is now Canadian and my IP is showing Canada, TikTok appears in the App Store.


I installed it as normal.


Once installed, I launched it (still with VPN on), logged in or restored my old account if I had it.


**Step 5:** Keep VPN active when launching TikTok
Even after installation, whenever I open TikTok, I leave the VPN on and ensure I’m connected to a non-U.S. server.


If I disconnect the VPN while TikTok is running, it might detect the U.S. region and block access.


**Step 6:** Fine-tuning & cache clearing
- I cleared cache or app data occasionally so that TikTok wouldn’t store location artifacts.


- If TikTok still refused to open, I tried different VPN servers in Canada or Mexico.


- In some cases, I toggled security settings (e.g. disabling IPv6 or WebRTC) in the VPN settings to prevent leaks.


- If that failed, I repeated Steps 3–5 with a fresh region (say, UK or Mexico) Apple ID.


That method is how I regained working TikTok on my iPhone, even months after the ban took effect.

## How To Get Tiktok Back if You Deleted It 
This is the method I used when I needed to download TikTok on a new device that had never had the app. It has several moving parts: a VPN, a foreign Apple ID (or changing region on your Apple ID), and sometimes an App Store trick that readers report helps.
Overview of the steps I used:
+ Install NordVPN app on the iPhone (set it up but don’t connect yet). I used a paid VPN with an iOS app, strong privacy policy, and servers in Canada and the UK.
+ Create a new Apple ID that is registered to a country where TikTok is available (I used Canada). Use an email address not tied to your existing Apple ID. When creating the account, you can skip adding a payment method initially (Apple usually allows “None” if you choose the correct country and don’t add card details).
+ On the iPhone, sign out of the current App Store (Settings → your name → Sign Out) or switch the App Store using the new Apple ID.
+ Connect the VPN and set the server to the country that matches the App Store region of the new Apple ID (e.g., Canada). Then open the App Store while still connected.
+ Search for TikTok in the App Store; if TikTok appears, download it normally. If it doesn’t appear, try the airplane-mode trick below.
+After download, sign into TikTok with your regular credentials and test functionality while connected to the VPN. If things work, you can sign the App Store back into your usual account — but note that updates may require you to re-switch region or keep the foreign account present.
Airplane-mode / App Store trick (reported to work for some): some users and community threads report that opening the App Store while in airplane mode with Wi-Fi enabled, then searching for TikTok and starting the download before toggling connectivity, can force the App Store to allow the download , especially if combined with a foreign App Store account and VPN. I tested a variation where I had VPN on, set the Apple ID region, launched the App Store with Wi-Fi on, and the download proceeded. Results vary by device and point in time; it’s a pragmatic trick rather than a guaranteed fix.

## How To Redownload Tiktok Via Browser 
If you don’t want to mess with VPNs or region accounts, here are other options I used or tested to redownload tiktok on iPhone easily:
+ **Use TikTok on the web:** The web version works in many cases with a VPN and is lower risk than installing a client. It won’t give you the full mobile experience, but you can watch, download, and sometimes upload content via the browser.
+ **Switch focus to other platforms:** Move core activity to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or Snap Spotlight until the legal picture stabilizes. Many creators used those parallel platforms while preserving their TikTok feeds offline.
+ **Export your content:** Back up everything you care about — posts, viewer lists, and drafts. You can re-post those to other services.
+ **Remote access to a non-US device:** Some creators with friends/family in other countries used remote desktop–style solutions to access a foreign device and upload content. This is more technical and riskier for privacy.

## The iPhone Challenge: Why It’s Harder Than Android
When I first tried to “just VPN and install,” I hit walls right away. Here are some of the iPhone-specific hurdles I encountered:

App Store region locking: Even if a VPN changes your IP, the App Store is tied to your Apple ID’s country or region. If your ID is U.S., Apple may refuse to show or reinstall TikTok.

No side loading: Unlike Android, you can’t just install an app from a random website (i.e. .apk). iOS doesn’t allow arbitrary installations (unless you're jailbroken).

App transfer restrictions: If TikTok was on another iPhone and you try to transfer it via iCloud, you often can’t restore it if it was deleted or never installed. 

Detection beyond IP: Some services (including TikTok) may use other metadata (GPS, device settings, account info) to detect you’re in the U.S. Even with a VPN, you can get blocked. 
In short: restoring TikTok on an iPhone after a ban is tricky. But not impossible — at least not always.


 
## Choosing a VPN For Tiktok: What Worked Best (and Why)
Not all VPNs are equal. Some are outright blocked or detected by TikTok. Over many trials, here’s what I found:
Essential VPN features for TikTok:
+ Obfuscation / stealth mode: to mask VPN traffic


+ Leak protection (DNS, IP, WebRTC)


+ Kill switch: if VPN drops, it stops traffic so your real IP isn’t exposed


+ Wide server network (especially in Canada, Mexico, UK)


+ Fast speeds & stable performance


**What I tested and what won**

I tried major names like NordVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN and found that NordVPN consistently succeeded in bypassing TikTok’s region checks. Many articles also point to it as a top choice.  Surfshark and ExpressVPN also worked for me in some trials, but they failed occasionally when TikTok’s detection logic changed. 
I dropped free VPNs altogether; they often lack the server diversity, speed, or stealth features TikTok demands. Even many paid VPNs were blacklisted. 
If you're shopping for one, make sure the provider offers a money-back window so you can test TikTok without being locked in.

## Final Thoughts
I’ll leave you with this: getting TikTok back on iPhone after the U.S. ban isn’t trivial. It’s borderline technical. But it is possible with patience, the right tools, and a few “trial and error” runs.
My method (region-switched Apple ID + robust VPN + careful launching) worked. It likely won’t always be foolproof . TikTok, Apple, or even the U.S. government could introduce new blocks. But for now, it’s a reliable path.
If you try this and hit a snag VPN not working, TikTok won’t show, app crashes, or reach out. I’ll help you troubleshoot the specific step. And if parts of this guide need updating in the future (new blocks, new tricks), I’m happy to revise it.
